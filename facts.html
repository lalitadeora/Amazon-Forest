                Shockingly, the first 9 months of 2022 saw the highest recorded deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016. The main causes of deforestation are cattle ranching and agriculture, the building of roads and other infrastructure, illegal logging, mining, and land grabbing and speculation.

                This would mean it could no longer be able to sustain itself as a tropical rainforest. Find out more about the risk of an Amazon tipping point in our Risking the Amazon report which shows that a third of the Amazon has already experienced at least one out of three key factors (reducing rainfall, increasing dry season length and accumulated deforestation of at least 20%) that could take us to a tipping point The Amazon is so vast and diverse, there is so much more to discover.

                Today, we stand on the brink of losing the Amazon as we know it. And if we lose the Amazon, we lose our fight against climate change. </h3>
                
                We’re working hard to protect this precious place, as well as the wildlife that lives there. We’re also working to support the rights of the indigenous and traditional people that call the Amazon home. This is not just about saving a forest, it’s about our one shared home and the future survival of all of us.
